# Classification - Intrusion Detection

Building Logistic Regression, KNN and Decision Tree models to predict whether a server connection is malicious. To compare each model's performance we use the Recall Score. Including client presentation. 

The models includes the use of:

* StandardScaler
* GridSearchCV
* PipeLine
* Recall Score

and the following libraries:

* SKLearn (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree)
* Seaborn (Visualization)

My Model was able to correctly identify malicious intrusions **98%** of the time.
